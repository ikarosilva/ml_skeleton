*git push 

*python examples/music_recommendation.py --encoder-type simsiam

*fix mlflow logging

*torch tensors @ 16bit resolution

*what parametre of annealing can we tune?

*review log for major issues



*write a plan for an inference pipeline (CLI based). make batch size configurable
with size of 500 files. The input argument should be the database location


Dynamic augmentations transforms for the encoder (small noise) ?

*Capture diversity of labels ? Generate a playlist that prioritizes songs that are in
sparse location in the embeddings. Called recommender_sparse.xspf.

Unlabelled songs?
How leverage MusicBrainz?

*Not sure if SQLite is best caching mechanism for features.
Should we use Parquet files instead in a ./cache folder? Make 
sure its excluded from git


*Add a step where we generate and plot a network graph 
of the artists in 3D. Can you generate in html so its 
interactive. Can you find a pleasant way to have a drop 
down menu where we can add select a meta tag to add 
without making the graph to noisy ? The meta tags that 
would be switched on/off would be : Genre and year.
