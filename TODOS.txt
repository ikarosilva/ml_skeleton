*write a plan for an inference pipeline (CLI based). make batch size configurable
with size of 500 files. The input argument should be the database location

**
Alot of files may have artist, filename, and albums with generic 
unknown names in either English of Portuguese. For example:
are name "Unknown", "Desconhecido"
Check how the clementine handles these (we may be able to recycle their 
code), and make sure we masks these labels from the encoder loss. In
cases where everything is unknown, we may wish to skip those tracks for
now.

*Not sure if SQLite is best caching mechanism for features.
Should we use Parquet files instead in a ./cache folder? Make 
sure its excluded from git


*Add a step where we generate and plot a network graph 
of the artists in 3D. Can you generate in html so its 
interactive. Can you find a pleasant way to have a drop 
down menu where we can add select a meta tag to add 
without making the graph to noisy ? The meta tags that 
would be switched on/off would be : Genre and year.


Dynamic augmentations transforms for the encoder (small noise) ?



*Capture diversity of labels ? Option to prioritize labels that are in
sparse location in the embeddings




Unlabelled songs?
How leverage MusicBrainz?
